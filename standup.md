## 🗓️ Date: 4-16-2025

### What I worked on yesterday:
- [x] [issue-1-general-css] Added color styles using `rgb()`, `hex`, and `hsl()`
- [ ] [issue-2-layouts] Started implementing flexbox on main layout
- [x] Created branches for all 7 issues
- [ ] Committed changes for `:hover` and `:active` pseudo-classes

### What I’m working on today:
- [ ] [issue-2-layouts] Finish grid layout implementation
- [ ] [issue-3-responsiveness] Start mobile-first media query
- [ ] Add Google Font to project and test rendering

###  Any blockers or issues:
- Having trouble using the `:has()` selector correctly — need to check browser compatibility
- Still deciding where to use `absolute` vs `relative` positioning

###  Notes or ideas:
- Consider splitting `issue-1-general-css` into 2 smaller branches for better clarity
- Might try nesting selectors using new 2023 syntax — research more on this
